## **Repositories Navigation**

I'm a learner in this ever-expanding tech industries. My goals in the year 2022 to is to be able call myself a full-stack web developer. I'm focusing on JavaScript tech stacks such as MERN, MEAN, MEVN. Currently, I'm learning vanilla JavaScript inside out as well as Node.js and also Python.

### **To navigate netween repos**

### **1. learn-xxx**

All repos that start with `learn` prefix indicates it is a study repos. I'm taking online courses, and by using GitHub as my source code management tool, I'm using it as to fortify my understanding and skill in GitHub workflow. Also, that little green box also serves as little rewards.

### **2. course-xxx**

All repos that start with `course` indicates it's a repo that is used for special and lengthy courses such as Professional Certificates, Specialization programs offered by **Coursera**, and **edX** to name a few. And yes, I do like taking online courses, both free and paid. That is my commitment.

### **3. miscellaneous**

All repos that does not follow the aforementioned naming convention are not learning repo nor course repo. It's probably my own works or my punching bag of GitHub 😅.
